Description: create and use a local lib/ for perl modules with PERL5LIB
 local::lib provides a quick, convenient way of bootstrapping a user-local
 Perl module library located within the user's home directory. It also
 constructs and prints out for the user the list of environment variables
 using the syntax appropriate for the user's current shell (as specified by
 the SHELL environment variable), suitable for directly adding to one's shell
 configuration file.
 .
 More generally, local::lib allows for the bootstrapping and usage of a
 directory containing Perl modules outside of Perl's @INC. This makes it
 easier to ship an application with an app-specific copy of a Perl module, or
 collection of modules. Useful in cases like when an upstream maintainer
 hasn't applied a patch to a module of theirs that you need for your
 application.
 .
 On import, local::lib sets the following environment variables to appropriate
 values:
